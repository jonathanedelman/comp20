The user's location is plotted correctly.  The user's infowindow either tells that no line was chosen or it tells the user that this is his/her marker, the closest T station plotted, and the distance to it.  The location of the stops of the line chosen (line is chosen by Ming's website) are plotted correctly.  All of these things have infowindows with their names.  The order of the polyline needs fixing.
